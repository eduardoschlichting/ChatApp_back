## :page_with_curl: About

The App makes use of the Socket.io library to build a realtime chat application. The app makes possible the communication between two or more clients in a specified server.

Some of the features of the app are:

- Sending and receiving messages in realtime
- Login with nickname or anonymously
- See who's online
- Joined and disconnected users notification
- Typing notification

This was a very simple build for learning purposes and can - and will - be expanded in the future. Some of the next features that can be added

- Rooms
- Private messaging
- Avatar selection or custom avatar upload
- Improved User Experience

## :hammer: Technologies

- Vue.js CLI
- JavaScript
- Node.Js
- Express
- Socket.io
- SASS


## :rocket: Seeing it in Action

To run the app, you will need to have Vue CLI installed on your machine, then:

Clone the repo:
`https://github.com/eduardoschlichting/ChatApp_Front`

Also, clone the server repo:
`https://github.com/eduardoschlichting/ChatApp_back`

<strong><i>I recommend cloning both repos in the same folder for easier access</i></strong>

Install the dependencies via npm
`npm install`

And then run the server on the front:
`npm run serve`

And run the server on the back:
`node app`


Send the front-end server link to friends and have fun!
